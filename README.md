# Sorting Visualizer

A web-based application to visualize various sorting algorithms. This interactive tool allows users to input or generate arrays and observe how different sorting algorithms work in real-time. The visualizer supports multiple sorting algorithms, highlights comparisons, and marks sorted elements, providing an educational and engaging way to understand sorting algorithms.

## Features
- **Interactive Interface**: Input custom arrays or generate random arrays.
- **Multiple Sorting Algorithms**: Visualize Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, Heap Sort, Counting Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Radix Sort, and Bucket Sort.
- **Real-time Visualization**: Watch the sorting process with animations, highlighting comparisons and swaps.
- **Control Buttons**: Start, pause, and reset the sorting process.
- **Statistics**: Track the total number of comparisons and swaps made during sorting.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: Structure of the web page.
- **CSS**: Styling for the visual elements.
- **JavaScript**: Functionality and sorting algorithms implementation.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/sorting-visualizer.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd sorting-visualizer
   ```
3. Open 

index.html

 in a web browser:
   ```sh
   start index.html
   ```
4. Use the navigation buttons to select a sorting algorithm.
5. Input an array or generate a random array.
6. Click "Start" to begin the visualization.
7. Use "Pause" to pause/resume and "Reset" to clear the array and statistics.

## Project Structure
- **index.html**: The main HTML file that sets up the structure of the web page.
- **style.css**: The CSS file that provides styling for the visual elements.
- **app.js**: The JavaScript file that implements the functionality and sorting algorithms.

## Sorting Algorithms Implemented
- **Bubble Sort**: Repeatedly swaps adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order.
- **Insertion Sort**: Builds the sorted array one item at a time.
- **Selection Sort**: Selects the smallest element from an unsorted list in each iteration.
- **Heap Sort**: Converts the array into a heap and then sorts it.
- **Counting Sort**: Counts the number of objects having distinct key values.
- **Merge Sort**: Divides the array into halves and merges them in a sorted manner.
- **Quick Sort**: Divides the array into smaller arrays based on a pivot.
- **Radix Sort**: Sorts numbers by processing individual digits.
- **Bucket Sort**: Distributes elements into buckets and sorts them.
